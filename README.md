# PathPlanningProject

This is a personal project for practicing C++ object-oriented design and algorithmic thinking.
The project simulates a path-planning system with a decision maker, planner, graph representation, and world simulation.

## Project Structure

- `include/` - Header files for each class
- `src/` - Implementation files
- `main.cpp` - Entry point of the program

## Goal

The goal of this project is to:
1. Practice C++ and object-oriented programming.
2. Implement core algorithms (path planning, decision making) from scratch.
3. Learn how to structure a simulation project in a modular and maintainable way.

## Status

- Skeleton code initialized
- No algorithms implemented yet
